# DO NOT ADD CODE TO THIS DIRECTORY

The intention of this component is to serve as basic functionality for projects that is provided by the template, such as versioning information and other useful facilities for barebones identification of the project that are autogenerated by CMake during configuration and build.

Previously this component was named `common` but that is a _common_ name for a component containing project specific common files (such as logging or whatever). Often times custom files were mixed in with the template autogenerated files which became messy. Feel free to create your own `common` component if you wish as the name is no longer restricted.
